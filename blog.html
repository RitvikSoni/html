            <p>Amber was a Meena state that replaced Khoh as the capital of Dhundhar after Kakil Deo, the son of Dulha Rai, defeated
            the Meenas.[2][3]
            
            The state of Jaipur was earlier known as Amber or Dhundhar and was controlled by Meena chiefs of five different tribes
            who were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti. Later a Kachhwaha prince Dulha Rai destroyed the
            sovereignty of Meenas and also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took Dhundhar fully under Kachwaha rule.[4]
            
            Much of the present structure known as Amber Fort is actually the palace built by Mughal Emperor Akbar's Navaratnas Raja
            Man Singh I who ruled from 1590 to 1614 AD. The palace includes several spectacular buildings, such as the Diwan-i-Khas,
            and the elaborately painted Ganesh Pole built by the renowned warlord Mirza Raja Jai Singh I (Man Singh I's grandson).
            The old and original fort of Amber, dating from earlier Rajas or the Mair or Maidh period, is what is known in the
            present day as Jaigarh Fort, which was actually the main defensive structure rather than the palace itself. The two
            structures are interconnected by a series of encompassing fortifications.[citation needed]
            
            Amber was capital of the Kachwaha until 1727 when the ruler of Amber, Sawai Jai Singh II founded a capital Jainagara
            (Jaipur), named after him, about nine kilometers south of Amber. After the founding of this new town, the royal palace
            and houses of prominent persons were shifted to Jaipur. The priests of Shila Devi temple, who were Bengali Brahmins,
            continued to live in the fort (to this date), while the Jaigarh fort above the palace also remained heavily garrisoned.
            The capital of Kachwaha was supplanted by the modern city of Jaipur, which is the capital of the Rajasthan state in
            India.[ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber,_India" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

            <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/c4/72/f6/jal-mahal-jaipur-tour.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&s=1" alt="">
            <p>The Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a grand
            scale. The building has a picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is equally the focus
            of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the surrounding
            Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built in red sandstone, is a five-storied building, of which four floors
            remain underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is exposed[citation needed].[1] One rectangular Chhatri on the
            roof is of the Bengal type. The chhatris on the four corners are octagonal. The palace had suffered subsidence in the
            past and also partial seepage (plaster work and wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of water logging, which
            have been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.[2]
            
            The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin layer
            of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the project
            area have also been used for constructing buildings. From the northeast, the Kanak Vrindavan valley, where a temple
            complex sits, the hills slope gently towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up of a thick
            mantle of soil, blown sand, and alluvium. Forest denudation, particularly in the hilly areas, has caused soil erosion,
            compounded by wind and water action. As a result, silt built up in the lake incrementally raises the lake bed.[3] On the
            terrace of the palace, a garden was built with arched passages. At each corner of this palace semi-octagonal towers were
            built with an elegant cupola.[4] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jal_Mahal">read more</a></p>

            <p>Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of
            Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The fort was
            originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is
            that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia,[1] whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the
            fort.[2] Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his
            name.[3]Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of

            <p>The Hathni Kund is a concrete barrage located on the Yamuna River in Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana state, India. It
            was constructed between October 1996 and June 1999 for the purpose of irrigation. It replaced the Tajewala Barrage 3 km
            (2 mi) downstream which was constructed in 1873 and is now out of service. The barrage diverts water into the Western
            and Eastern Yamuna Canals. The small reservoir created by the barrage also serves as a wetland for 31 species of
            waterbird.[1]
            
            Plans to replace the Tajewala Barrage had been in the works since the early 1970s but an agreement between the
            governments of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh (which share the water it diverts) was not made until July 1994.[2] Although
            the barrage was completed in late 1999, it was not operational until March 2002 because of work delays.[3] The barrage
            is 360 m (1,181 ft) long and its spillway is composed of ten main floodgates along with five undersluices on its right
            side and three on its left. The maximum discharge of the barrage is 28,200 m3/s (995,874 cu ft/s) (1 in 500 year
            flood).[4]The Hathni Kund is a concrete barrage located on the Yamuna River in Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana state, India. It
